In my professional life, the internal IT department needed a application that could monitor,
for a certain period, multiple pc's. But, it also demanded that you can
monitor at all times when a host comes alive or goes offline and it
should be possible to leave the application alive while you work.

Simple and robust, easy to use (for other people to).

So i decided for my self that i wrote this application and publish it as open source.

We used this tool every day during a cycle of two year Windows 7 migration.
